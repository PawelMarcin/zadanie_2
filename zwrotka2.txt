Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain
He used to say so strong, unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me
Hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried
