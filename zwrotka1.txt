Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
I used to cry for Tracy because I wanted to see him again
But sometimes, sometimes life ain't always the way
